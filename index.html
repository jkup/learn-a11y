      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./static/jon.jpeg" alt="Jon Kuperman Avatar" />
      <p>
        Hello. My name is Jon Kuperman. I've been a software engineer for the
        last 12 years. I spent most of my career doing web development with a
        focus on accessibility and web performance.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Accessibility</h2>
      <blockquote>
        When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with
        disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are
        developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or
        impossible for some people to use. Making the web accessible benefits
        individuals, businesses, and society.
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Similar Fields</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Web Performance</li>
        <li>Internationalization</li>
        <li>UI Design</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities
        can <b>perceive, understand, navigate, and interact</b> with the Web,
        and that they can <b>contribute to the Web</b>.
      </p>
      <h2>Some Statistics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          26 percent (one in 4) of adults in the United States have some type of
          disability.
        </li>
        <li>2 in 5 adults age 65 years and older have a disability</li>
        <li>
          20 percent of people in the US (48 million people) report some degree
          of hearing loss, and 29 million of them could benefit from using
          hearing aids.
        </li>
        <li>
          2.3 percent of people in the US (7 million people) report having a
          visual disability, and 1 million people in the US are legally blind.
        </li>
        <li>
          16 percent of people in the US (39 million people) have difficulties
          with their physical functioning. 17.1 million people would find it
          very difficult or impossible to walk unassisted for a quarter mile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roughly 8 million people in the US have an intellectual disability,
          including 425,000 children.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Types of disabilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobility and physical</li>
        <li>Cognitive and neurological</li>
        <li>Visual</li>
        <li>Hearing</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The web is already accessible (even if your website is not)</h2>
      <p>
        For example, let's check out
        <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">
          The first website </a
        >. It's very easy to use with assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <h2>Reasons developers should learn accessibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It's fun!</li>
        <li>We're the ones making it inaccessible</li>
        <li>Human Rights</li>
        <li>Legal Issue</li>
        <li>Reach a larger audience</li>
        <li>Impactful</li>
        <li>Makes you a specialist</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Amazing ways people use the web</h2>
      <h3>Keyboard Only</h3>

      <h3>Head Wand</h3>

      <h3>Mouth Stick</h3>

      <h3>Single Switch</h3>

      <h3>Screen Reader</h3>

      <h2>Curb cut effect</h2>
      <img src="./static/curb-cut.jpeg" alt="Lady pushing stroller up ramp" />
      <blockquote>
        The Curb-Cut Effect, in its essence, asserts that an investment in one
        group can cascade out and up and be a substantial investment in the
        broader well-being of a nation -- one whose policies and practices
        create an equitable economy, a healthy community of opportunity, and
        just society.
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Accessibility Standards</h2>
      <h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a>
      specifies three different
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels"
        >conformance levels</a
      >
      they are:
      <ul>
        <li>A (lowest)</li>
        <li>AA (mid range)</li>
        <li>and AAA (highest)</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        Level A sets a minimum level of accessibility and does not achieve broad
        accessibility for many situations. For this reason, UC recommends AA
        conformance for all Web-based information.
      </blockquote>
      <h3>WebAIM</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAIM</a>
        provides a handy
        <a href="https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist">checklist</a> with
        their recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>WebAIM specifies that accessible websites should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perceivable</li>
        <li>Operable</li>
        <li>Understandable</li>
        <li>Robust</li>
      </ul>
